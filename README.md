# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This project was built with the overloaded coding bootcamp student in mind. I wanted a place to be able to organize all of the information I've learned from bootcamp all into one place. This project was built to help students understand the overall foundational elements of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Git; encouraging them to study more about each one. It demystifies the whole process of starting out in web development, pointing out what every web developer needs to know in order to be successful. I personally learned a lot developing this site, starting with the importance of formulating solid HTML as it is the foundation of any weebsite. Next, undertanding the importance of CSS and formating code so it is appealing to the user. Lastly, the language that makes everything tick: JavaScript, and how you wouldn't be able to interact with the webpage without it. This project stands out because although there might me replicas of this page, my personal thoughts and worded notes make topics easy for users to understand and apply to their projects.
